Win32::GUI::OpenGLFrame - Integrate OpenGL with Win32::GUI

  Win32::GUI::OpenGLFrame allows you to use OpenGL for drawing
  in Win32::GUI windows.

  It provides a child window (or frame) that can be drawn into
  using OpenGL primatives.  The interface is modified slightly
  from the standard Win32::GUI style so as to be (slightly)
  more familiar to those used to using the glut interface
  on Win32.

  It should eb possible to have more than one Win32::GUI::OpenGLFrame
  window with differetn content.  demos\example3.pl shows this in
  action.

  I am not an OpenGL expert, and all the OpenGL code is 'borrowed'
  from elsewhere, and may or may not be good style.

  The C bindings (XS) and OpenGL code in OpenGLFrame.PL could use
  a review from an OpenGL specialist.
